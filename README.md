Product Development with a UX Design  perspective

**Product Development:** *The creation of products with new or different characteristics that offer new or additional benefits to the customer.
 Product development may involve modification of an existing product or its presentation, or formulation of an entirely new product that satisfies a newly defined customer want or market niche.*


Product development is the process of designing, creating and marketing new products or services to benefit customers. Sometimes referred to as new product development, the discipline is focused on developing systematic methods for guiding all the processes involved in getting a new product to market.

Product development involves either improving an existing product or its presentation, or developing a new product to target a particular market segment or segments. Consistent product development is a necessity for companies striving to keep up with changes and trends in the marketplace to ensure their future profitability and success. A competitive product development strategy should include a company-wide commitment to creating items that fulfill particular consumer needs or characteristics. These characteristics might include consumers' desire for the following: products that are high-quality or low-cost; products that provide the consumer with speed or flexibility; or products that offer some other form of differentiation that posits them a desirable purchase.
