 ##### Guerrilla Usability Testing
   involves testing designs with friends and family. You can take paper sketches and review them with people and use that feedback to inform revisions and improvements.

 **User-centered:** Service is a result of collaboration between a service provider and a customer. It should speak in a customer's language and reflect the customer's needs.
 **Co-creative:** Service design is about designing with people, not just for them. There are various stakeholders involved in creating, providing and consuming the service. The process of designing services should include all of them.
 **Sequencing:** Every service has its own pace. Sometimes it can be too slow, resulting in bored customers, and sometimes it is too fast, stressing them out. Service should always keep up with customers' expectations.
 **Evidencing:** In order to be noticed, intangible services should be accompanied with physical evidence: mail, brochures, souvenirs, etc... They can trigger the memory of positive service moments far into the post-service period.
 **Holistic:** Environments where service takes place, engaging customer journeys and their alternative forms, the corporate culture and staffing of service providers—all these aspects, together, create the service mindset.
